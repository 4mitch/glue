# glue

Trying to glue cljs and vue together.

## Overview

So far main idea is just to configure components via clojurescript.
This is a small demo with figwheel so far.
Might release a library later.

## Figwheel setup

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
